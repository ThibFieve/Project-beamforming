Project: Beamforming 

Project in the scope of the course of Wireless Communication from Polimi. 

Tasks: The goal was to use Beamforming techniques and diversity on an array of antennas to maximize the SNR of two object moving simultaneously on 2 different tracks. 

Result: In order to simulate the perturbation due to the environment present in a real-life scenario, the wireless communication channel had to be simulated by us using Quadriga libraries on MATLAB. We used a LOS+ Multipath scenario. Then Beamforming techniques had to be implemented and we implemented Null Steering and LMS. The latter yielded better results and was kept for measurements. OFDM was implemented for even better Results.Doppler effect of the moving vehicle had to be taken into account.
