Beamforming and Tracking with Quadriga libraries.Matlab
Sep 2020 â€“ Dec 2020

Beamforming project , consist of tracking and using different Beamforming techniques to maximise SNR. The Channel is simulated by using the Quadriga Libraries on MATLAB.
In the matlab code you can see that we manage to implement Null steering and LMS in the case of a  LoS + simplified multipath scenario for the channel. The later was used as it yields better results
